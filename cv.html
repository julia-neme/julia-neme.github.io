                  <h2>Education</h2>
                  <h4>PhD in Climate Science: Variability and Forcing Mechanisms of the Weddell Gyre</h4>
		  	<p>The Weddell Gyre, located east of the Antarctic Peninsula, is one of the dominant features of the Southern Ocean circulation. The gyre is involved in different processes relevant to the global climate, such as the production and export of Antarctic Bottom Waters. Despite its relevance, little is known about the gyre’s variability in connection to forcing mechanisms. My PhD aims to expand on the present knowledge about the dynamics of the Weddell Gyre by using coupled ocean/sea ice models, running targeted numerical experiments and dynamically motivated techniques.</p>

                  <h4>Licenciatura in Physical Oceanography: Surface variability of the Brazil Current in the period 2009 - 2015</h4>
		  	<p>I used a reanalysis product, OSCAR Surface Currents, to study the surface variability of the Brazil Current at the SAMOC initiative latitude during the period 2009 to 2015. We found that the surface speed of the current is strongly modified by transient eddies, which are able to double or even reverse the current’s velocity for up to 30 days. Cyclonic eddies weaken the Brazil Current and induce a cold surface temperature anomaly, whilst anticyclonic eddies strengthen the Current and induce a warm surface temperature anomaly.</p>

		<h2>Sea going experience</h2>
		<h4>Multidisciplinary Investigations of the Southern Ocean - 2024 (8 weeks)</h4>
			<p>The MISO voyage seeks to explore how links between physics, biogeochemistry, plankton, aerosols, precipitation and clouds influence the Earth’s climate, from the deep ocean to the lower atmosphere. More on the Australian Antarctic Program Partnership <a href=https://aappartnership.org.au/miso/>blog</a></p>

		<h4>East Australian Current - 2022 (3 weeks)</h4>
			<p>In this voyage we recovered the East Australian Current mooring system, in place from 2012 to 2022.</p>

		<h4>South Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation - 2018 (2 weeks)</h4>
			<p>In this voyage we carried out a periodic hydrographic survey to monitor the South Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.</p>
